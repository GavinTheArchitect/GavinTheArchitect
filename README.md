<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

My fascination with technology began not with formal coursework, but with a fundamental curiosity about how systems work. This passion, which I've pursued since the age of 12, led me to cybersecurity. I have now spent five years deeply immersed in systems engineering, offensive security tradecraft, and autonomous tool development.

I believe in mastering both sides of security: I build and I break. Operating with a "purple-shaded" methodology, I thrive on this duality.

**My Trajectory:** I'm aiming for Tier 1 exploit development and advanced penetration testing, on par with teams like Google's Project Zero, Apple SEAR, and the NSA's TAO. I am planning to become a future CISO and Offensive Security Architect.

<h4 align="center">Event_Zero – Autonomous Malware Annihilation Engine</h4>
<p align="center">
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/GavinTheArchitect/Event_Zero">View Repository →</a></strong>
    <br>An experimental, AI-driven architecture for the autonomous deconstruction and behavioral mapping of malicious code. It gives a Tier 1 AI (Google Gemini) full autonomy within a hardened BlackArch container to hunt, dissect, and neutralize threats.
</p>

* **Autonomous Decision Core:** Reasoning engine with authority to install any of BlackArch's 2800+ tools (Radare2, Ghidra, Frida, etc.) and write custom analysis scripts.
* **Adaptive Analysis:** AI pivots from static to dynamic analysis in real-time.
* **Self-Healing Protocol:** AI analyzes its own tool/script failures and regenerates corrected code to continue the mission.
