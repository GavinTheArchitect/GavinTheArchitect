"I will lead your cybersecurity team in a way that directly safeguards our financial performance and brand reputation. By implementing a proactive security program—focused on penetration testing and vulnerability analysis—we will not only prevent potential cyberattacks that could cost millions in damages but also reduce long-term operational costs associated with incident response. We will measure our success by key metrics such as a reduced mean time to detect and resolve threats, which will provide a clear return on security investment and ensure we are a resilient, trusted organization."

I will transform our security function from a defensive cost center into a strategic business enabler, making our security posture a key market differentiator. My vision is to not only safeguard our company from AI-powered cyber threats but to enable unprecedented innovation and customer trust by leveraging a new generation of security expertise.

My strategy is a holistic, full-spectrum approach, grounded in a deep technical mastery of systems and a relentless, proactive mindset. As a force multiplier, I will:

### Advance our Defensive Capabilities
I will apply my advanced OS-level expertise—from creating a custom, security-focused Linux distribution (ShadowStrike OS), to debloating and modifying Windows for security, and hardening macOS—to build a resilient infrastructure. I will also implement custom enterprise MDM profiles to ensure a baseline of security across all our devices, additionally I have developed an organization when I was in high-school on GitHub known as ShadowGuardAI where I use CI/CD to produce entire GitHub Repositories made by AI focusing on defensive AI tool-development.

### Unleash the Power of Offensive Security
I will embed an offensive security mindset across the team. By leveraging my experience in reverse engineering, bug bounty hunting, and AI-driven tools (Event_Zero), we will actively hunt for and neutralize threats before they can be exploited. This proactive approach will be our secret weapon, providing a continuous feedback loop that makes our defenses stronger every day.

### Cultivate a New Kind of Security Team
I will lead the team by example, empowering them with the same dual-sided thinking I have applied throughout my career. I will mentor and develop my team, leveraging my experience as a National NSA Codebreaker Challenge winner (placed in the top 16% nationally while competing solo against university teams), a GIAC Advisory Board member, and a participant in the FBI Teen/Youth Engagement and Mentorship (TEAM) Program. My goal is to transform the team into a collaborative powerhouse that not only executes but innovates, establishing our brand as the most trusted in the industry. These accolades validate my expertise, as I was also recognized as a National Cyber Scholar with Honors for three consecutive years, placing in the top 1% of tens of thousands of participants and earning $12,000 in scholarships from the Cyberstart America National Competition.

### Academic and Professional Foundations
I hold the GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC) and GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT) certifications. My academic record, including being an AP Scholar with Honors and one of the only dual-award recipient in Business and Computer Science at my High School from a graduating class of ~1000 students, additionally I have achieved top 1% programmers in the United States on my other GitHub Account which I have since stopped using since 17. All of this confirms a strong theoretical understanding to complement my hands-on experience.

### Enable Growth & Innovation
I will partner with business units to ensure security is a core component of our innovation and market expansion. By embedding a security-first culture throughout the organization, we will not only prevent costly breaches but also unlock new opportunities for growth and resilience.

Outside of work, I build discipline and creativity through a mix of physical and technical pursuits, including biking, advanced photography, martial arts, weight lifting, DJing, and music production. Also sometimes but very rarely, I play Video Games due to wanting to engage and communicate with others outside of work, though there are other ways I do these that are usually more effective. These hobbies directly support my ability to remain focused and innovative under pressure.

I've included a link to a secondary GitHub profile that archives my early work and projects from high school. This profile serves as a testament to my long-standing passion and dedication to the field, demonstrating a history of hands-on experience and continuous learning. I maintain a separate professional profile to highlight my current, college-level work and a more focused set of projects that align with my professional and academic goals. This allows me to showcase my growth from a young enthusiast to a focused, professional cybersecurity expert.

I am currently planning to place high in the GoogleCTF and I’m training for this CTF.
